## degree - Convert temperature to different types

**Note:** Starting October 12 2023, Microsoft GitHub
is forcing me to use 2FA to access to my repositories.
Microsoft wants me to use my Cell Phone or some proprietary
application for 2FA, email is not allowed.  So updates to
this project will no longer occur on GitHub.  Updates and
full Source can be downloaded from my Gemini Capsule:

* gemini://gem.sdf.org/jmccue/computer/repository.gmi
* gemini://sdf.org/jmccue/computer/repository.gmi (mirror)

[See gemini wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol)#Software) for clients.

degree(1) is a silly utility that prints out temperatures
in various scales.

On some Systems units(1) may support this conversion.

[j\_lib2](https://github.com/jmcunx/j_lib2) is an **optional** dependency.

[GNU automake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automake)
only confuses me, but this seems to be good enough for me.

**To compile:**
* If "DESTDIR" is not set, will install under /usr/local
* Execute ./build.sh to create a Makefile
* Works on Linux, BSD and AIX

_To uninstall_, execute
"make uninstall"
from the source directory
